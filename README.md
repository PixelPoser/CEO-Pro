## 🧮 Theoretical Framework

We formulate the business strategy optimization process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), defined as a tuple (S, A, P, R, γ):

- S: State space representing business scenarios
- A: Action space of possible strategies
- P: S × A × S → [0, 1], transition probability function
- R: S × A → ℝ, reward function
- γ ∈ [0, 1], discount factor

Our novel approach approximates value functions through prompt engineering:

V(s) ≈ 𝔼_π[R(s, a) + γV(s')]

Where s' is the next state after taking action a in state s according to policy π.

## 💻 Implementation Details

### Multi-Model Orchestration

The system dynamically routes tasks to different LLMs based on their strengths:

- Gemini 1.5 Pro: Primary reasoning and strategy generation
- Claude-3-sonnet: Meta-cognitive evaluation and critique
- GPT (text-embedding-3-large): Vector embedding generation

### Vector Database Integration

We employ a 1536-dimensional vector space to represent business knowledge, using cosine similarity for efficient retrieval:

sim(q, d) = (q · d) / (||q|| ||d||)

Where q is the query vector and d is a database entry vector.

### Strategy Formulation Process

The strategy formulation is an iterative optimization problem:

strategy* = argmax_strategy 𝔼_s~p(s) [V_φ(s, strategy)]

Subject to constraints C = {c_1, c_2, ..., c_m} representing business rules and limitations.

## 📊 Output

The system generates two key documents:

1. **Comprehensive Business Plan** (`Final_Business_Report.md`)
2. **Detailed Implementation Plan** (`Final_Implementation_Plan.md`)

These documents provide actionable insights and strategies that have been thoroughly vetted and optimized through our AI-driven process.

## 🧪 Testing
